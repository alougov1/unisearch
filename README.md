# UniSearch
A website that allows students to create an account and compare their statistics and interests to those of universities across the country.  Currently, we only support a small handful of universities that are being used mostly as test data, but we're hoping to expand the offering in the near future.

## Important Information
The code is open-source, but it contains dummy data for database credentials.  We are looking into hosting options once we improve on the project in case we decide to publish it.

## Technology
Built with React, MySQL, Express.js/Node.js, and AWS RDS.

## Future Plans:
Improve security
Add more data
Add more features (comparing two universities, etc)
Improve design and user flow
